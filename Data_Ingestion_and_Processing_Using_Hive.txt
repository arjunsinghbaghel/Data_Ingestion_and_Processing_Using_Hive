-- *** Title: The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission [TLC] Analysis ****
-- Brief: This assignment is centered on the concepts of Data Ingesting and Analyzing Big Data on the APACHE-HIVE platform.
-- The dataset provided contains trip details made by taxis in New York City.
-- Our analysis is focused on the yellow taxis for the months of November and December 2017.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- *** Data Dictionary ******
-- The Data Dictionary for this dataset is as follows: [Field Name--Description]
-- [1] vendorid--A code indicating the TPEP provider that provided the record. 1= Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC; 2= VeriFone Inc. 
-- [2] tpep_pickup_timestamp--The date and time when the meter was engaged.
-- [3] tpep_dropoff_timestamp--The date and time when the meter was disengaged.
-- [4] passenger_count--The number of passengers in the vehicle. This is a driver-entered value.
-- [5] trip_distance--The elapsed trip distance in miles reported by the taximeter.
-- [6] rate_code--The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip. 1= Standard rate 2=JFK 3=Newark 4=Nassau or Westchester 5=Negotiated fare 6=Group ride.
-- [7] store_forward_flag--This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor, aka store and forward, because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server. Y= store and forward trip N= not a store and forward trip.
-- [8] pickup_location--TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was engaged.
-- [9] dropoff_location--TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was disengaged.
-- [10] payment_type--A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip. 1= Credit card 2= Cash 3= No charge 4= Dispute 5= Unknown 6= Voided trip.
-- [11] fare_charge--The time-and-distance fare calculated by the meter.
-- [12] extra_charge--Miscellaneous extras and surcharges.  Currently, this only includes the $0.50 and $1 rush hour and overnight charges.
-- [13] mta_tax_charge--$0.50 MTA tax that is automatically triggered based on the metered rate in use.
-- [14] tip_amount--Tip amount – This field is automatically populated for credit card tips. Cash tips are not included.
-- [15] tolls_charge--Total amount of all tolls paid in trip.
-- [16] improvement_surcharge--$0.30 improvement surcharge assessed trips at the flag drop. The improvement surcharge began being levied in 2015.
-- [17] total_charge--The total amount charged to passengers. It does not include cash tips.

-- Above Statistics shows that the average tip paid per trip is not representative of central tendency 
-- 25% or more values bein zero tip do play a high part in this behaviour
-- again the median 1.36 is much lower then the avg 1.82 due to the skewness towards higher values
